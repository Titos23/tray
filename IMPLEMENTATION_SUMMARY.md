2. **Visual Continuity**: Consistent colors, fonts, spacing throughout
3. **Timing Precision**: All animations match specified durations
4. **Psychological Design**: Every interaction has purpose and feedback
5. **Graceful Degradation**: All edge cases handled smoothly
6. **Zero Friction**: Minimal cognitive load, maximum clarity
7. **Trust Building**: Transparent about data usage and permissions

## 🚀 How to Run

1. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

2. **Run the app**:
   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

3. **Test the flow**:
