### ⚙️ Behavior Notes

- Must have one goal and one activity selected to proceed.
- Computation formula (executed in background):
 base = weight(kg) × factor(objective)
objective factor:
- maintain: 1.4–1.6
- gain: 1.8–2.2
- lose: 1.6–2.0
activity multiplier:
- sedentary: 0.9
- active: 1.0
- regular: 1.1
- intense: 1.2
sex adjustment:
- male × 1.05
- female × 0.95

- Result stored for Page 4C display.

### 💡 Design Principles
- Decision through touch, not text.
- Only one choice visible per cluster (reduces overload).
- Each selection feels rewarding (micro-feedback).
- Clean white background, consistent with earlier screens.
